## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 16.x or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps carefully to set up and run the application:

### Step 1: Install Root Dependencies

Open your first terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Install App Dependencies

Open a new terminal and navigate to the app directory:

```bash
cd app
npm install
```

### Step 3: Install Client Dependencies

Open another terminal and navigate to the client directory:

```bash
cd app
cd client
npm install
```

### Step 4: Install Server Dependencies

Open another terminal and navigate to the server directory:

```bash
cd app
cd server
npm install
```

### Step 5: Start the Application

Now you need to run both the server and client simultaneously. Open **2 new terminals**:

#### Terminal 1 - Start the Server

```bash
cd app
cd server
npm run dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

#### Terminal 2 - Start the Client

```bash
cd app
cd client
npm run dev
```

The client will start on `http://localhost:5173`

## Accessing the Application

Once both servers are running:

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
3. You'll see the login page for the TU Robotics Club Attendance System

```

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Radix UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **QR Code**: QRCode.react and HTML5-QRCode
- **State Management**: React Query + Zustand

## Database Setup

The application uses Supabase as the database. The connection is already configured in the code. If you need to set up your own database:

1. Create a Supabase account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Update the Supabase credentials in the configuration files
4. Run the SQL migrations found in `server/db/` directory

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Port conflicts**: If ports 3000 or 5173 are in use, the applications will automatically try alternative ports
2. **Database connection**: Ensure Supabase credentials are correctly configured
3. **Camera permissions**: For QR scanning, ensure your browser has camera permissions enabled

### If you encounter errors:

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed in each directory
2. Check that both server and client are running
3. Verify your browser supports camera access for QR scanning
4. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Frontend components go in `app/client/src/components/`
2. New pages go in `app/client/src/pages/`
3. Backend routes go in `app/server/src/routes.ts`
4. Database schemas are in `shared/schema.ts`

### Building for Production

```bash
cd app
npm run build
```

## Logo Setup

For proper branding, you need to set up the TU Robotics Club logo:

1. Add the following files to the `app/client/public/` directory:
   - `robotics-logo.png` - Primary logo image
   - `robotics-logo.svg` - SVG fallback (already provided)

2. For detailed instructions, see the [logo setup guide](app/client/public/logo-instructions.md)
